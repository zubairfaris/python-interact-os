> Final Project for Using Python to Interact with the Operating System course by Google on Coursera.org

### Project Name

> Log Analysis Using Regular Expressions

### Introduction

Imagie your company uses a server that runs a service called ticky, an internal ticketing system. The service logs events to syslog, both when it run successfully and when it encounters erros.

The service's developers need your help getting some information from those logs so that they can better understand how their software is used and how to improve it.
So, for this lab, you'll write some automation scripts that will process the system log and generate reports based on the info extracted from the log files.

### Modus Operandi

* Use regex to parse a log file
* Append and modify values in a dictionary
* Write to a file in CSV format
* Move files to the appropriate directory for use with the CSV -> HTML converter
